This is a project I worked on a few years ago that involved creating a start up that would compete to recieve funding from the school or get axed. We ended up winning best in show receieving the maximum investment amount. This was a great introduction to engineering a simple embedded system using flexible resistors to measure stress on a roller as well as using insulated wiring to heat the foam roller.
