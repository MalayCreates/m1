Project I worked on for a few years to buy and sell stocks and crypto with varied success. Worked with others to process large amounts of stremed data quickly, and create clean and testable code. This is a rudimentary version that I can publicy show of a simple trading algorithm that could work. I am unable to show joint source code as that may lead to IP loss.
